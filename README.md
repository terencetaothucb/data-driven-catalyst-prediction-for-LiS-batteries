# Catalyst‚ÄìLiPS Adsorption Energy Prediction

This repository provides the full implementation of the machine learning framework used in our study to predict adsorption energies between metal-based catalysts and lithium polysulfides (LiPS). The model is based on a multi-expert bootstrap-ensemble of Random Forest regressors and is built entirely in MATLAB.

The code enables end-to-end reproduction of the training, validation, prediction, and visualization procedures described in the manuscript.
